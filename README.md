### 🧠 Project: Cars93 Data Analysis
1. Performed **data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Cars93 dataset using Python libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.
2. Handled **missing and duplicate values**, replaced them using statistical methods (mean/mode), and categorized variables into **categorical and continuous** features.
3. Conducted **visual analysis** through histograms, bar plots, pair plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to uncover trends and relationships between car features.
4. Explored **correlations among key variables** such as price, horsepower, weight, and engine size to identify factors affecting car pricing.
5. Generated a **clean and processed dataset** for further analysis or machine learning applications.
